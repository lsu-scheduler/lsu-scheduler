                by Salesforce.com in 2010. Heroku, one of the first cloud platforms, has been
                in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language,
                but has since added support for Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python and PHP and
                (undocumented) Perl. The base operating system is Debian or, in the newest stack,
                the Debian-based Ubuntu.</p>

          <p class="lead">PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis
              on extensibility and standards-compliance. As a database server, its primary
              function is to store data, securely and supporting best practices, and retrieve
              it later, as requested by other software applications, be it those on the same
              computer or those running on another computer across a network (including the
              Internet). It can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications
              to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users. Recent versions
              also provide replication of the database itself for security and scalability.</p>
